# Story Time
'Story Time', a framework for community made interactive stories.

This is just an idea I wanted to try out. Essentially a system which loads a text based RPG style 'story' from a file and presents it to the user. These stories will made up of scenes, where each scene is a block of text describing the situation and the choice which the user must make, followed by the options which the user can pick from. The catch is that, unless I later decide otherwise, each choice has only one answer which does not result in death/the premature ending of the story. Picking this answer will move on to the next scene, but picking another will present the user with a description of how they died and the story will end. The idea is that if a story was a good length and the correct choices weren't obvious then one would have to attempt it several times in order to reach the true ending.

I will create a template for stories when the code for this is closer to finished, as I don't know whether my current template will change.
