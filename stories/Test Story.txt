You are in the woods alone. There is an axe on the ground, and paths leading east and west. A path north is blocked by debris.;Take the Axe:You take the axe and use it to clear the debris and head north.;Go east:You take only a few steps down the eastern path before you are mauled to death by a pack of wolves.;Go west:The western path leads you to a hungry bear. You try to run, but it catches you and ends your journey.;1
Eventually you come to a clearing. There are three unfriendly looking men on the far side of it, with their backs turned to you.;Creep up and attack them:They hear you coming and turn around, revealing that they are armed with rifles. You are shot down instantly.;Announce yourself:You call to the men. They turn around, revealing that they are armed with rifles, before smiling and waving you over. You would become the best of friends, and one day start a sign making business together.;2
